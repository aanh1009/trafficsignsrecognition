**A Traffic Sign Classifier for Autonomous Vehicles** 

This project is a deep learning model built upon convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and fully connected layers to classify traffic signs in an autonomous vehicle. 

**Dataset**

The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) is a multi-class, single-image classification challenge held at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2011.
